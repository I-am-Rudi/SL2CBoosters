# SL2CBoosters.jl

A Julia package for computing SL(2,C) boosters, providing efficient C-based calculations with a Julia interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing the package, make sure you have the following system dependencies:

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
```

#### Arch Linux/Manjaro
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake gmp mpfr libmpc
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install cmake gmp mpfr libmpc
```

#### Windows
1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. Open MSYS2 MinGW64 shell and run:
```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-gmp mingw-w64-x86_64-mpfr mingw-w64-x86_64-mpc
```
3. Add `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to your system PATH

### Package Installation

Install the package directly from GitHub:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.develop(Pkg.PackageSpec(name="SL2CBoosters", url="https://github.com/I-am-Rudi/SL2CBoosters.git"))
```

## Usage

```julia
using SL2CBoosters

# Example usage code here
```

## Development

For local development:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/I-am-Rudi/SL2CBoosters.git
cd SL2CBoosters
```

2. Set up local development:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.develop(path=".")
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:

1. Clean and rebuild:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.rm("SL2CBoosters")
Pkg.develop(Pkg.PackageSpec(name="SL2CBoosters", url="https://github.com/I-am-Rudi/SL2CBoosters.git"))
```

2. For verbose build output:
```julia
Pkg.build("SL2CBoosters", verbose=true)
```

## Common Issues

- If you get library loading errors, ensure all system dependencies are properly installed
- For Windows users, verify that MSYS2's bin directory is in your system PATH
- For macOS users with Apple Silicon, ensure you're using the ARM64 version of Julia
